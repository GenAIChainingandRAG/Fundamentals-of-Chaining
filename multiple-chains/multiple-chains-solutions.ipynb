    "## Chain Review \n",
    "**LCEL** allows you build complex chains with runnable components, \"runnables\" greatly reducing the amount of code you need to write for common model tasks. They come with common methods or interfaces that you can use in many situations. You quickly switch out components and create chains of chains (multiple chains). \n",
