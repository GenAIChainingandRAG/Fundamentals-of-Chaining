       "AIMessage(content=\"Writing effective prompts, whether for creative writing, educational exercises, or artificial intelligence (AI) interactions, requires clarity, focus, and engagement. Here are several tips to help you craft better prompts:\\n\\n### 1. **Be Clear and Specific**\\n- **Avoid Ambiguity**: Ensure your prompt clearly communicates what you want. Ambiguity can lead to misunderstandings or irrelevant responses.\\n- **Provide Context**: A little background can help orient the response and make it more relevant.\\n\\n### 2. **Engage the Audience**\\n- **Use Interesting Hooks**: Start with an intriguing question, a surprising fact, or a compelling statement to grab attention.\\n- **Know Your Audience**: Tailor your language, complexity, and content to fit the interests and understanding of your target audience.\\n\\n### 3. **Encourage Creativity and Critical Thinking**\\n- **Open-Ended Questions**: Instead of yes/no questions, ask open-ended ones that encourage deeper thought and original responses.\\n- **Challenge Assumptions**: Prompts that challenge preconceived notions can stimulate more thoughtful engagement.\\n\\n### 4. **Provide Structure, But Allow Freedom**\\n- **Guidelines vs. Constraints**: Offer enough guidance to prevent confusion but avoid overly restrictive instructions that could stifle creativity.\\n- **Suggest, Don’t Dictate**: Encourage exploration of different perspectives or solutions rather than implying there’s a single correct answer.\\n\\n### 5. **Use Active Voice**\\n- **Direct and Dynamic**: Active voice makes your prompts more engaging and easier to follow than the passive voice.\\n\\n### 6. **Iterate and Refine**\\n- **Feedback Loop**: Use responses to refine and adjust your prompts. What worked? What didn’t? Continuous improvement is key.\\n- **Test Your Prompts**: If possible, test your prompts on a small scale to see how they perform and make adjustments as needed.\\n\\n### 7. **Consider Timing and Sequencing**\\n- **Progressive Complexity**: Start with simpler prompts and gradually increase complexity to build confidence and engagement.\\n- **Timing**: Be mindful of when the prompt is presented. Timing can affect the willingness and ability to engage thoughtfully.\\n\\n### 8. **Incorporate Multimedia**\\n- **Visuals and Audio**: Sometimes, a picture or sound clip can inspire more than words alone. Consider incorporating multimedia elements to enrich the prompt.\\n\\n### 9. **Be Open to Surprise**\\n- **Embrace Unexpected Responses**: Sometimes, the most off-the-wall responses can be the most insightful or creative. Don't dismiss them outright.\\n\\n### 10. **Practice Empathy**\\n- **Consider Perspectives**: Try to imagine how different people might interpret or respond to your prompt. This can help make your prompts more inclusive and engaging.\\n\\nBy applying these tips, you can craft prompts that are not only clear and engaging but also stimulate creativity, critical thinking, and meaningful responses. Whether for educational purposes, creative exercises, or AI interactions, effective prompts are the foundation for productive and enjoyable engagement.\", response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 601, 'prompt_tokens': 15, 'total_tokens': 616}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4-0125-preview', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_a7daf7c51e', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None})"

It was the largest amphitheater ever built at the time and hosted gladiatorial contests, public spectacles, and various other events. Its impressive ruins still stand today, offering a glimpse into the past and the grandeur of the Roman Empire.\n",

      "2. **The Vatican City** - Although technically an independent city-state enclaved within Rome, the Vatican is a pivotal attraction for visitors. It is the spiritual and administrative center of the Roman Catholic Church and the residence of the Pope. The Vatican Museums and the Sistine Chapel, with Michelangelo's famous ceiling and 'The Last Judgment', are among the most visited sites. St. Peter's Basilica, with its magnificent dome designed by Michelangelo, stands as a masterpiece of Renaissance architecture.\n",

      "3. **The Pantheon** - This ancient Roman temple, now a church, is renowned for its remarkable preservation and stunning architecture. It was built between A.D. 118 and 125 by Emperor Hadrian and is famous for its massive dome, which remains the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome. The Pantheon's oculus, the opening at the dome's apex, offers a unique connection between the building's interior and the outside world.\n",
